A group project undertaken at Digital Futures to explores the data provided by SWAN Teleco (a fictional company), drawing insights on the types of customers who churn and the reasons why they leave.

This project used four different machine learning models to predict whether a consumer will churn or not. After conducting model evaluations, we concluded that our logistic regression model and sklearn random forest model were the most robust and accurate. Therefore, a combination of these two models were used to make our final predictions.

Our final model predicts whether a customer will churn with 80.1% accuracy on both the train and test data sets, making it very robust.
